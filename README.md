# Claw Chaos

**Claw Chaos** is a physics-first, high-fidelity claw machine simulator.

The project goal is not to fake a claw-machine result with a hidden success roll. The claw, suspended head, prize geometry, center of mass, friction, collisions, swing, closing force, retaining force, pile state, and prize chute should produce the result through simulation.

> Design principle: if the player sees it happen, the simulation should explain why it happened.

## Project goals

- First-person view that feels like standing in front of a real machine.
- Realistic X/Z gantry motion, acceleration, braking, suspended claw swing, descent, early close, lift, return, and release.
- Real rigid-body prize interaction: grab, slip, hook, push, drag, rotate, flip, jam, collide, and fall.
- Separate close / pickup / retaining force instead of one abstract "claw strength".
- Player-controlled **early close** ("收爪") while descending.
- Support realistic **claw swinging / 甩爪** techniques instead of a scripted skill button.
- Support a limited **hold boost** mechanic separately from Taiwan-style guaranteed-prize / "保證取物" rulesets.
- Multiple machine families: 3-prong plush crane, 2-prong UFO-style machine, mini crane, premium crane.
- Hundreds of prize variants from data-driven geometry, materials, colors, mass, friction, and center-of-mass profiles.
- Staff call, prize repositioning, restocking, machine servicing, and operator simulation.
- Progressive implementation: use the closest stable approximation when a physically exact simulation is too expensive or unstable.

## Current phase

**M02 IN PROGRESS — Gantry & Suspended Claw**

M01 — Claw Physics Laboratory is complete and remains the locked physics-contact baseline. The three-prong claw now has six automated physics experiments covering centered pickup, pickup→retaining-force slip, off-center rotation, Teddy limb hook, independent blocked-finger behavior, and oversized-object close blocking. Generic COM/origin visualization now reads Rapier's actual rigid-body mass properties and is shared across the sphere, box, Teddy, oversized prize, and future registered bodies.

Final M01 verification baseline:
- 29 automated tests PASS
- lint PASS
- TypeScript/Vite build PASS
- GitHub Pages base-path PASS
- headless Rapier/WebGL smoke PASS
- collider debug remains available with `D`
- COM/origin debug is available with `M`
- no prize parenting, hidden weld, scripted success/failure, or normal-play prize teleport was introduced

M02 slice 1 is now implemented: fixed-step X/Z carriage motion with explicit speed/acceleration/braking limits, a dynamic claw hub physically suspended from a kinematic carriage through a Rapier spherical joint, and automated PT-006 swing-from-braking verification. The closed M01 three-finger geometry and revolute joints are reused rather than replaced.

### First milestone

A gray-box machine containing:

- one 3-prong claw,
- one gantry,
- suspended claw dynamics,
- early close,
- close / pickup / retaining force,
- a box, ball, and simple teddy,
- 10–15 prizes,
- a physical prize chute.

It is successful when the same physical system can naturally produce:
- a stable pickup,
- a slow slip,
- an off-center rotation,
- a hook,
- a failed grip,
- a push/drag,
- and swing-induced release,

without parenting or magnetically attaching the prize to the claw.

## Core non-negotiables

1. Do not decide pickup success with RNG in pure simulation mode.
2. Do not parent a grabbed prize to the claw.
3. Do not teleport prizes during normal play.
4. Do not replace collision outcomes with canned animation.
5. Preserve horizontal claw momentum during descent.
6. Separate physical hold force from guaranteed-prize rules.
7. Build machine and prize content from configuration data rather than hard-coded one-off logic.
8. Prefer stable approximations over unstable "perfect" soft-body or rope simulation.

## Proposed technical direction

Initial recommended stack:

- TypeScript
- PlayCanvas or another WebGL/WebGPU-capable 3D engine
- Rapier 3D for rigid-body physics
- Vite
- fixed-step physics, initially targeting 120 Hz
- deterministic seeds for repeatable test scenes where practical

The engine choice remains a pre-production decision; physics behavior and acceptance criteria are authoritative over any specific framework.

## Reference machine families

The design is inspired by real commercial machine behavior rather than a single brand or cabinet. Reference categories include:

- SEGA UFO CATCHER-style 2-prong machines
- commercial 3-prong plush cranes
- ELAUT-style premium cranes
- mini cranes / keychain machines
- Taiwan self-service claw-machine rulesets and guaranteed-prize operation

See the design documents for which behaviors are simulated directly and which are approximated.

## Immediate next step

Continue **M02 — Gantry & Suspended Claw** from the verified fixed-length suspension baseline.

Current M02 slice:
- default scene: `?scene=gantry-lab`
- Arrow keys: manual X/Z gantry motion
- `P`: deterministic PT-006 accelerate → brake → observe swing sequence
- carriage motion is fixed-step with explicit max speed, acceleration, braking, and rail limits
- claw hub is dynamic and suspended through a Rapier spherical joint
- M01 independent fingers remain dynamic/revolute-driven on the suspended hub
- `D`: collider debug
- `M`: COM/origin debug
- 33 automated tests PASS after this slice

PT-006 is a behavior proof, not final real-machine calibration. Current provisional hard-brake run produces about 0.067 m lag, 0.135 m forward swing, and 0.45 rad peak swing.

Next M02 slice should add **variable reel length / vertical descent-lift mechanics** while preserving horizontal momentum. That enables PT-008 and prepares early-close/automatic-close work without starting cabinet/chute mechanics.

## Status

This repository is the source of truth for the Claw Chaos project.
