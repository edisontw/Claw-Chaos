# Claw Chaos

**Claw Chaos** is a physics-first, high-fidelity claw machine simulator.

The project goal is not to fake a claw-machine result with a hidden success roll. The claw, suspended head, prize geometry, center of mass, friction, collisions, swing, closing force, retaining force, pile state, and prize chute should produce the result through simulation.

> Design principle: if the player sees it happen, the simulation should explain why it happened.

## Project goals

- First-person view that feels like standing in front of a real machine.
- Realistic X/Z gantry motion, acceleration, braking, suspended claw swing, descent, early close, lift, return, and release.
- Real rigid-body prize interaction: grab, slip, hook, push, drag, rotate, flip, jam, collide, and fall.
- Separate close / pickup / retaining force instead of one abstract "claw strength".
- Player-controlled **early close** ("收爪") while descending.
- Support realistic **claw swinging / 甩爪** techniques instead of a scripted skill button.
- Support a limited **hold boost** mechanic separately from Taiwan-style guaranteed-prize / "保證取物" rulesets.
- Multiple machine families: 3-prong plush crane, 2-prong UFO-style machine, mini crane, premium crane.
- Hundreds of prize variants from data-driven geometry, materials, colors, mass, friction, and center-of-mass profiles.
- Staff call, prize repositioning, restocking, machine servicing, and operator simulation.
- Progressive implementation: use the closest stable approximation when a physically exact simulation is too expensive or unstable.

## Current phase

**M01 in progress — three-prong claw laboratory mechanics are live**

M00 is complete. M01 now has a three-prong mechanical baseline plus a realistic-geometry refinement: cylindrical claw head, three independent Rapier revolute-joint fingers, segmented hooked rod geometry, three capsule colliders per finger, motorized open/close control, joint diagnostics and collider debug rendering. Development remains focused on gray-box claw physics rather than cabinet/arcade content.

### First milestone

A gray-box machine containing:

- one 3-prong claw,
- one gantry,
- suspended claw dynamics,
- early close,
- close / pickup / retaining force,
- a box, ball, and simple teddy,
- 10–15 prizes,
- a physical prize chute.

It is successful when the same physical system can naturally produce:
- a stable pickup,
- a slow slip,
- an off-center rotation,
- a hook,
- a failed grip,
- a push/drag,
- and swing-induced release,

without parenting or magnetically attaching the prize to the claw.

## Core non-negotiables

1. Do not decide pickup success with RNG in pure simulation mode.
2. Do not parent a grabbed prize to the claw.
3. Do not teleport prizes during normal play.
4. Do not replace collision outcomes with canned animation.
5. Preserve horizontal claw momentum during descent.
6. Separate physical hold force from guaranteed-prize rules.
7. Build machine and prize content from configuration data rather than hard-coded one-off logic.
8. Prefer stable approximations over unstable "perfect" soft-body or rope simulation.

## Proposed technical direction

Initial recommended stack:

- TypeScript
- PlayCanvas or another WebGL/WebGPU-capable 3D engine
- Rapier 3D for rigid-body physics
- Vite
- fixed-step physics, initially targeting 120 Hz
- deterministic seeds for repeatable test scenes where practical

The engine choice remains a pre-production decision; physics behavior and acceptance criteria are authoritative over any specific framework.

## Reference machine families

The design is inspired by real commercial machine behavior rather than a single brand or cabinet. Reference categories include:

- SEGA UFO CATCHER-style 2-prong machines
- commercial 3-prong plush cranes
- ELAUT-style premium cranes
- mini cranes / keychain machines
- Taiwan self-service claw-machine rulesets and guaranteed-prize operation

See the design documents for which behaviors are simulated directly and which are approximated.

## Immediate next step

Continue **M01 — Claw Physics Laboratory** with **PT-001 centered ball pickup**.

The current `claw-lab` already provides:
- rigid hub plus three independent dynamic fingers,
- Rapier revolute joints and physical motor limits,
- configurable open/close motor command,
- `C` close, `O` open, `Space` toggle,
- `D` collider debug,
- visible joint pivot/axis diagnostics,
- realistic segmented hook geometry with three capsule colliders per finger,
- centralized provisional dimensions in `docs/CLAW_GEOMETRY_BASELINE.md`,
- active GitHub Pages deployment.

Next add one real dynamic sphere with explicit mass/friction and prove that three physical contacts can support and lift it. Prize parenting, hidden welds and scripted pickup success remain prohibited.

## Status

This repository is the source of truth for the Claw Chaos project.
